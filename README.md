# Origin Lens – Verify Image Authenticity with C2PA Content Credentials

**Combat fake news and misinformation by verifying the authenticity of images with cryptographic provenance data.**

Origin Lens analyzes images for C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) Content Credentials and EXIF metadata to detect AI-generated content, verify digital signatures, and reveal the complete edit history of any image. All verification happens on your device with zero data collection.

Built with a modern Material 3 design, Origin Lens provides powerful media verification tools in a clean, intuitive interface.

## ✨ What Makes Origin Lens Different?

Origin Lens goes beyond simple metadata viewing. It performs cryptographic verification of Content Credentials, detects AI-generated content from multiple sources, and provides comprehensive provenance analysis. All verification happens locally on your device.

### � C2PA Content Credentials Verification

Cryptographically verify the authenticity of images.

- **Digital signature validation** – Verify cryptographic signatures on embedded C2PA manifests
- **Certificate chain verification** – Check if signers are trusted and certificates are valid
- **Tamper detection** – Identify if content has been modified since signing
- **Signer information** – View organization, issuer, and timestamp details
- **Multiple verification states** – Verified, Invalid Signature, Expired Certificate, Untrusted, or No Manifest

### 🤖 AI Generation Detection

Identify AI-generated content from multiple sources.

- **C2PA assertions analysis** – Detect AI generators from standard Content Credentials
- **EXIF metadata parsing** – Find AI signatures in image metadata
- **Dual-source detection** – Combines C2PA and EXIF for comprehensive coverage
- **50+ AI generators detected** – Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Adobe Firefly, and more
- **Detection source transparency** – Shows whether AI was detected via C2PA, EXIF, or both

### 📜 Complete Edit History Timeline

See every action performed on an image.

- **Action-by-action timeline** – View capture, edit, and publish events
- **Software agent tracking** – Identify tools used to create and modify content
- **Timestamp information** – When each action occurred
- **Digital source type** – Understand the origin (camera capture, screen capture, AI generation, etc.)

### � EXIF Metadata Analysis

Access detailed image metadata.

- **Camera information** – Make, model, and settings
- **Software details** – Applications used to create or edit the image
- **Artist and copyright** – Creator attribution
- **Date and time** – When the photo was taken
- **AI detection markers** – Prompt parameters, generation settings, and AI tool signatures

### 📤 Multiple Input Sources

Analyze images from anywhere.

- **Photo Library** – Select from your gallery
- **Files App** – Access iCloud Drive and local files
- **URL Analysis** – Paste image URLs for remote verification
